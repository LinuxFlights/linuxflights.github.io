Hello World! I am CJ, as you know already I was previously known online as LinuxGamer, after a long think, I decided that it was time for a rebrand and I have done it, I am now introducing myself again and explaining a couple of things.

## About Me
I'm CJ, a dyslexic artist, gamer, writer, programmer and content creator. I love aviation, space, and technology. I create digital paintings, illustrations and pixel art, I make games in both 2D and 3D (mostly using the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/)). I use primarily open source software and advocate for this. I write novels and blog posts/articles about technology news/reviews, art, companion articles to any videos I produce, and anything else I want to put on here.
