Hello World! I am CJ, as you know already I was previously known online as LinuxGamer, after a long think, I decided that it was time for a rebrand and I have done it, I am now introducing myself again and explaining a couple of things.

## About Me
I'm CJ, a dyslexic artist, gamer, writer, programmer and content creator. I love aviation, space, and technology.
